# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

### Prerequisites

This software requires Java Runtime Environment(JRE).  
  
To check if you have JRE on your Windows machine, press the windows key + r to open the run line.  Once opened, type in "appwiz.cpl" and hit enter.  
  
A new window will appear that displays all the programs installed onto your computer. In the search bar, type in "java" and see if anything shows up.  
  
If you don't see a listing that says "Java 8 Update 241", or if you have a java listing that is a version below 241, then you will need to download the latest JRE.  
  
You can download it here: https://www.java.com/en/download/  
  
Run the executable and follow the instructions on the install wizard.

### Installation

If you only want to run and use the software, click on the "Sorting Algorithms Visualizer.jar" file above and then download it.  
  
Once it is done downloading, open the file and you'll be all set. The window for the software can take a few seconds to pop up, so please be patient if it isn't instantaneous.  
  
  
  
If you would like to edit or review the code in a development environment, you will first need to go download and install the Eclipse IDE.
Eclipse can be downloaded here: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/  
  
Once you have Eclipse installed onto your system, scroll up and click the green button titled "Clone or download" and then click "Download ZIP".  
  
After it's done downloading, you can then import the project into Eclipse.  
  
If you don't know how to import java projects into Eclipse, you can follow the instructions on this website: https://www.360logica.com/blog/how-to-import-a-java-project-into-eclipse-ide/  
  
This site uses visual aids to guide you through the process, which I think is a lot better than me explaining it through text.  
  
Have fun and thank you for checking out my software!
